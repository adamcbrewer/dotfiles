# Restore To Factory Settings

Converting a Macbook (or any Mac for that matter) back to factory settings. Useful to speed-up and de-clutter an old machine. If you have your dotfiles up-to-date then getting back up to speed shouldn't take long at all.

From [this thread](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH11273):

Important: To reinstall OS X, you need to be connected to the Internet.

+ Choose Apple menu > Restart. Once your Mac restarts (and the gray screen appears), hold down the Command (⌘) and R keys.
+ If you’re not connected to the Internet, choose a network from the Wi-Fi menu (in the top-right corner of the screen).
+ Select Disk Utility, and then click Continue.
+ Select your startup disk from the list on the left (normally the first partition), and then click the Erase tab.
+ From the Format pop-up menu, choose Mac OS Extended (Journaled), enter a name for your disk, and then click Erase.
+ After the disk is erased, choose Disk Utility > Quit Disk Utility.
+ Select Reinstall OS X, click Continue, and then follow the instructions.
